# Relation between test programs and their plots.
# A test program is tied to a list of implementations that should be
# /skipped/ when plotting it. For each line of configuration, an output
# file name is specified. The paths are relative to plots/.
# Any programs not found in this relation will be processed normally, i.e.,
# they will be plotted, written to a .pdf file, and no implementations will be
# skipped.
# Lists are delimited by comma, and the empty list is the single comma.

# Program name        Skip impls.  Input data name   Plot transform     Output file name
